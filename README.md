# Decision-Tree-Implementation

Implemented a ÔÄÅxed depth decision tree algorithm. The input to your algorithm includes
the training data set and the maximum depth of the tree. For example, if the depth is set to one, a decision tree with one test node will be learned. 
Tested implementation on Monks and Blood Transfusion Service Center datasets.
Started from depth = 1 and went to different depths (2,4,6,8...,16). For each depth, computed
the error on the test set.
Plotted a learning curve with the depth of the tree on the x-axis and the accuracy on the y-axis.
Reported the learned decision tree and the confusion matrix.
